CGC monitoring and analysis scripts for Simics.
See 015-forensics-cqe.txt for requirements.
See ../docs/performance.txt for a discussion of the implementation
strategy for the different monitoring functions.


These scripts require Simics.  The top level script is cgcMonitor.py.
It should be run from the Simics command line:
simics> run-python-file cgcMonitor.py

You may first need to set your path to these scripts
via "add-directrory -prepend".


TBD: 
  o Clean up python paths, the challenge is getting things to properly
    reference in the Simics environment.
  o Include os awareness classes after they are cleaned up. (These
    are not required for monitoring, only analysis.)
  o Add monitoring of fork/exec and network access?
  o Clean up hardcoded paths and component names (see cellConfig.py)

  o Enumeration of Linux kernel executable sections (modules), currently uses text2 hack
  o Make local copy of CB for use by Ida
  o Linux not yet getting name of thrower file
