# NAME

demoRepo  -- Summary or repos used for testing.

# SYNOPSIS

Author-generated challenge sets are retrieved from cgc-dev
using the fetchSets.py script, which stores local copies
of each debian package in /mnt/vmLib/bigstuff/cfe-cset-packages.
That script also extracts from each .deb into /mnt/vmLib/bigstuff/challenge-sets
(but only if the package is newer than the local copy.)
